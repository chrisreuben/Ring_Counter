#Ring_Counter 
This repository contains the implementation of an optimized Ring Counter, a type of sequential circuit used in digital systems. A ring counter cycles through a predefined sequence of states, where only one bit is active ("1") at any given time, with the rest set to inactive ("0"). The optimization includes improvements in resource utilization, speed, and power efficiency, making it suitable for applications where low-latency and minimal power consumption are crucial.

Key features:

Sequential circuit design
Enhanced performance and reduced power consumption
Optimized for hardware implementations such as FPGAs and ASICs
